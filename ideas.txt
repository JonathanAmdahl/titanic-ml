create new features:
    could see if they are married from name - done
    family size - done
    bin the age groups (child, adult, elderly) - done
    fare per person - done
    hasCabin - done
    isTravellingAlone - done
    Deck from cabin number - done
    fare bins - done
    family survival rate - done
    ticket frequency, (number of passengers with the same ticket number)
    isParent - done

Interactions between features:
    age * class 
    embarked * pclass
    sex * pclass
    sibsp * pclass
    parch * pclass
    fare * pclass
    isMarried * pclass
    isParent * pclass
    isTravellingAlone * pclass
    HasCabin * pclass

    #biggest ones imo
    isParent * sex
    age * sex
    pClass * sex
    pClass * age
    p

impute the data differently
hyperparameter tuning - DONE, on final model could squeeze a tad more
regularization (L1 or L2) DONE
Cross Validation - DONE

Number to beat #1: 86.3%
Basic hyperparameter tuning: 91.4%
I tuned too early, so resetting the tune
Number to beat: 80% validation accuracy
Number to beat #2: 80% validation accuracy
Training accuracy: 85.5%; on training;
Training accuracy: 90.2% on training;
added binning to age, fare, and extracted title from name: 90.12%
added isMarried: 91.1%
added isParent, family size, and family size bins: 85.7% (performance dropped, so we will need to clean features)
isTravellingAlone, deck, cabin, fare per person - 88.9% (something here was useful)
family survial rate - 87.7% (performance dropped slightly)
removed sibsp, fare, and title - 91.2%
added interactions - 92.1%
advanced age imputation - 92.9%

in the future, do hyperparameter tuning last
